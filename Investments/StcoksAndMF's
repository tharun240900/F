What is a Stock Market?

    A stock market is a place where shares (stocks) of companies are bought and sold.

    Simple explanation:
        When a company needs money to grow, it can sell small pieces of ownership called shares.
        People who buy these shares become part-owners of the company.
        The stock market is the system that allows people to trade these shares.
